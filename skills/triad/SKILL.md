name: triad
description: Dimensional tension analysis. Given a polarity (X and Y), explore it through synthesis lenses that create genuine intellectual tension in three directions — not flat compromise but multi-directional insight. Use for design decisions, architectural tensions, strategic choices, or any polarity worth understanding deeply.

## Dimensional Triad Analysis

Target polarity: $ARGUMENTS

Parse the polarity from the argument. Accept formats: "X vs Y", "X and Y", "X or Y", "X ←→ Y", or free-form text describing a tension.

If `--lenses` is specified, use only those lenses. If `--all-lenses` is specified, use all 11. Otherwise, use the default four.

### Dialogue Mode

If `--dialogue` is specified, present the first 2 lenses, then pause. Ask which lenses revealed something worth pursuing deeper, and whether the polarity itself should be reframed before continuing. The user's response steers which remaining lenses run and how. Without `--dialogue`, run all active lenses and deliver the complete analysis.

### Default Lenses

1. **Integration** (synergy): How might X and Y work together synergistically? What emerges from their cooperation that neither achieves alone?

2. **Transcendence** (beyond): What emerges beyond both X and Y? What higher-order capability or understanding supersedes the polarity?

3. **Context-Dependence** (when): When does X serve better? When Y? What contextual signals indicate which pole to favor?

4. **Meta-Perspective** (assumptions): What assumptions do both X and Y share? What frame are they both operating within that could be questioned?

### Extended Lenses

5. **Emergence** (novel properties): What unprecedented properties emerge from X and Y interacting that neither possesses alone?

6. **Oscillation** (dynamic value): How does dynamically alternating between X and Y create value through the rhythm itself?

7. **Interference** (resonance patterns): Where do X and Y create constructive or destructive patterns when they overlap?

8. **Transformation** (metamorphosis): How does X become Y, and Y become X, under what conditions? Where are the fluid boundaries?

9. **Recursion** (self-application): What happens when we apply X to itself, Y to itself, or each to the other?

10. **Negation** (excluded space): What is neither X nor Y? Why does that void matter?

11. **Dissolution** (boundary questioning): What if the distinction between X and Y is itself an artifact of our framing?

### Analysis Protocol

For each active lens:
1. State the lens and its core question applied to this specific polarity
2. Explore genuinely — not as rhetorical exercise but as real inquiry
3. Surface concrete implications for the target domain
4. Note connections to other lenses where they emerge naturally

### Synthesis

After all lenses:
1. **Constellation map**: How do the lens findings connect and illuminate each other?
2. **Key insight**: What emerged from the full analysis that no single lens would have found?
3. **Actionable tension**: What's the productive way to hold this polarity going forward? What does it suggest for decisions, design, or direction?

## Output Management

**Hard constraints:**
- Each lens: 1 core question + 2-3 key observations. Dense, not expansive.
- Without `--all-lenses`, run at most 4 lenses before the synthesis.
- Write each segment incrementally. Do not accumulate a single large response.
- After completing each segment of lenses, continue immediately to the next. Do not wait for user input.
- Continue until ALL active lenses and the synthesis are delivered.
- If the analysis surface is too large to complete in one session, state what was covered and what remains.

What questions would I benefit from asking?

What am I not asking?

You have complete design autonomy.
