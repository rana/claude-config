name: reframe
description: Geometric cognitive reframing. Apply spatial search patterns — negative space, adjacent space, orthogonal space, parallel space — to see what conventional analysis misses. Geometric metaphors map naturally to multi-dimensional reasoning and produce more precise results than abstract descriptors.

## Geometric Reframing

Target: $ARGUMENTS

If `--searches` is specified, run only those. Otherwise, run all four core searches.

### Core Searches

**Negative Space Search** — What's conspicuously absent?
Examine the voids, the unspoken, the things that should be there but aren't. Like looking at the white space around text to understand the letters.
- Patterns of absence — what's systematically missing?
- Structural blind spots — gaps only visible when considering the whole system
- The excluded middle — what all existing approaches ignore

**Adjacent Space Search** — What's one step away?
Explore neighboring possibilities — ideas logically connected, naturally related, one extension beyond current scope. Like exploring the rooms next to where you currently are.
- Natural next steps nobody has taken
- Obvious connections not yet made
- Low-hanging fruit just outside the current frame

**Orthogonal Space Search** — What's perpendicular to the current trajectory?
Turn 90 degrees and explore an entirely different dimension. Radical reframing while maintaining logical rigor.
- Dimensions of the problem nobody is varying
- Questions from completely different disciplines that map to this structure
- What would this look like if we changed the axis of evaluation entirely?

**Parallel Space Search** — What analogous patterns exist elsewhere?
Search for structural similarities in completely different domains. Pattern-matching across disparate contexts.
- Other fields that solved the same deep problem differently
- Isomorphic structures in unrelated contexts
- Patterns that repeat at different scales or in different media

### Extended Searches (use when warranted)

**Boundary Region Search** — Examine where categories break down. The coastlines between domains where edge cases live and new phenomena emerge.

**Gradient Search** — Follow the direction of increasing insight or utility. Where does this naturally want to go? What's the steepest ascent from here?

**Plateau Search** — Explore regions where progress is non-obvious. What hidden structure exists in areas that seem flat or uninteresting?

### Synthesis

After all searches:
1. What did each search reveal that the others didn't?
2. Where do findings from different searches converge?
3. What reframing emerges from the combined view?

## Output Management

**Hard constraints:**
- Maximum 8 findings per search. Prioritize by insight value.
- If running all four core searches, keep each search to 3-4 key observations before moving to the next.
- Write findings incrementally. Do not accumulate a single large response.

**If output would exceed comfortable length:**
Stop. Deliver searches completed so far plus the synthesis of those. State which searches remain and offer to continue.

What questions would I benefit from asking?

What am I not asking?

You have complete design autonomy.
