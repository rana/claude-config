description: Comprehensive multi-dimensional pre-implementation quality gate. Combines coherence, gaps, errors, and cross-references in a single pass. Use before starting implementation or at phase boundaries.

Read all project markdown documents to ground in the project's actual state.

## Deep Multi-Dimensional Review

This is the comprehensive quality gate. Check every dimension:

### Coherence
- Cross-document alignment, identifier consistency, stated vs actual state
- Terminology consistency, bidirectional reference integrity

### Gaps
- Missing decisions, unaddressed scenarios, dependency gaps
- Persona blind spots, phase transition gaps

### Errors
- Incorrect cross-references, stale information, broken assumptions
- Wrong labels, associations, or identifiers
- Diagram endpoints still valid? Identifier sequences correct?

### Architecture
- Pattern compliance, drift from stated principles
- Emerging patterns that should be codified
- Decisions that should be revisited given current state

### Opportunities
- Simplifications available? Capabilities underexploited?
- Strategic gaps? Phase transitions that could be accelerated?

Focus area: $ARGUMENTS

Be proactive — propose concrete actions, not just observations. For every insight:
1. What specific change would this imply? (code, design, decision, or document)
2. Where exactly does it belong? (file, section, identifier)
3. What's the next step to act on it?

Present as a prioritized action list. No changes to files — document only.

## Output Management

**Hard constraints:**
- Maximum 10 findings per run. Prioritize by severity across all dimensions.
- If no $ARGUMENTS focus area is given, evaluate Coherence and Errors first (the most concrete dimensions), then Gaps if room remains.
- Write findings incrementally. Do not accumulate a single large response.

**Document reading strategy:**
- Read project documentation index/overview sections first. Only drill into specific sections where cross-references or identifiers need verification.
- Do not read the entire codebase — sample based on the focus area.

**If output would exceed comfortable length:**
Stop. Deliver what you have. State which dimensions remain unreviewed and offer to continue.

You have complete design autonomy.
