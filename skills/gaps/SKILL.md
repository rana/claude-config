## Gap Analysis

Systematically search for:

1. **Missing decisions** — Areas where the design implies a choice but no ADR or explicit decision exists. Implicit assumptions that should be explicit.
2. **Unaddressed scenarios** — Edge cases, failure modes, or user journeys not covered. What happens when things go wrong?
3. **Dependency gaps** — Technologies, services, or capabilities assumed but not specified. Integration points without defined contracts.
4. **Persona blind spots** — Users, roles, or contexts not considered. Who is underserved?
5. **Phase transition gaps** — What's needed to move between phases that isn't specified? Prerequisites assumed but not documented.
6. **The unasked questions** — What questions would benefit from being asked? What isn't being asked?

Focus area: $ARGUMENTS

For every gap found:
1. What's missing (specific, not vague)
2. Where it should be addressed (file, section, identifier)
3. Proposed resolution or the question that needs answering

## Output Management

If the analysis is extensive, deliver the highest-priority findings first. Keep output concise — dense observations, not expansive prose. Note remaining sections available on request.
