name: inversion
description: Systematic assumption flipping. For every key decision, invert it and examine what emerges. A creativity and stress-testing tool — not to change direction, but to verify that choices are load-bearing rather than habitual.

## Inversion Analysis

Target: $ARGUMENTS

For each key assumption or decision in the target area:

1. **State the assumption** — What has been decided or assumed? Make it explicit.
2. **Invert it** — What if the opposite were true? What if this decision went the other way?
3. **Explore the inversion** — Not as a strawman, but genuinely: what would the system look like? What problems would it solve? What problems would it create?
4. **Load-bearing or habitual?** — Is the original decision load-bearing (the inversion clearly fails) or habitual (the inversion is surprisingly viable)?
5. **Hybrid insight** — Does the inversion reveal a middle path or a partial truth that the original framing missed?

Apply inversions across dimensions:
- **Technical**: "We use X technology" → "What if we used the opposite approach?"
- **Structural**: "This is one service" → "What if it were many?" (or vice versa)
- **Process**: "We do X first" → "What if we did X last?"
- **Scope**: "This is in scope" → "What if we explicitly excluded it?"
- **Defaults**: "The default is X" → "What if the default were not-X?"

For every inversion:
1. The original assumption
2. The inverted version
3. What's genuinely interesting about the inversion
4. Whether the original holds stronger or weaker after examination

Present as a structured list. Flag any inversions that reveal genuine alternatives worth considering.

## Output Management

If the analysis is extensive, deliver the highest-priority findings first. Keep output concise — dense observations, not expansive prose. Note remaining sections available on request.
