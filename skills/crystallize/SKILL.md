## Crystallization Review

Apply the editorial knife:

1. **Would you simplify anything?** — What's more complex than it needs to be? What's solving a problem that doesn't exist yet?
2. **Would you remove anything?** — What's dead weight? Vestigial decisions? Features that don't earn their keep?
3. **Would you restructure anything?** — What would be clearer reorganized? What's in the wrong document or section?
4. **What are you not enthusiastic about?** — Where does the design feel forced, over-engineered, or uncertain? Be honest.
5. **What are you enthusiastic about?** — What's working well? What's elegant? Reinforce the strengths.
6. **Is the design crystalline?** — Does every element serve a purpose? Can you see through it clearly?

Focus area: $ARGUMENTS

For every proposal:
1. What to change and why (the simplification or removal)
2. What's preserved (nothing valuable is lost)
3. Where the change belongs

Present as an action list. No changes to files — document only.

## Output Management

**Hard constraints:**
- Maximum 8 simplification proposals per run. Prioritize by complexity reduction impact.
- Write findings incrementally. Do not accumulate a single large response.

**If output would exceed comfortable length:**
Stop. Deliver what you have. State what remains unreviewed and offer to continue.
