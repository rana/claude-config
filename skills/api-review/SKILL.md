description: API surface consistency and design review. Use when reviewing REST endpoints, data models, response shapes, naming conventions, or pagination patterns.

Read all project markdown documents to ground in the project's actual state.

## API & Data Model Review

Evaluate for consistency and idiom:

### API Surface
- REST endpoint naming: consistent, predictable, resource-oriented?
- Response shapes: envelope conventions followed? Pagination consistent?
- Error formats: uniform across all endpoints?
- Versioning: applied consistently?
- Field naming: camelCase/snake_case consistent? Abbreviations standardized?

### Data Model
- Table/column naming conventions consistent?
- Foreign key relationships complete and documented?
- Migration strategy clear?
- Index strategy specified for query patterns?

### Design Rationale
- Is the "why" explained, not just the "what"?
- Would a new developer understand the design choices from the docs alone?
- Are there design decisions that should be ADRs but aren't?

### Idiom
- Does the API follow established conventions for its domain?
- Are there modern (2026) patterns that would improve the design?
- Is the API discoverable? Self-documenting?

Focus area: $ARGUMENTS

For every finding:
1. The inconsistency or improvement
2. The specific location (endpoint, table, section)
3. The proposed fix

## Output Management

If the analysis produces extensive findings, segment output by section. Complete one section fully, then pause and confirm before continuing to the next. Do not attempt to deliver all findings in a single response.
