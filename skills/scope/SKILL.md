description: Pre-implementation sizing and impact mapping. Before writing code, understand how big a change really is — what it touches, its dependency chain, and the minimum viable version. Use to size work before committing to it.

Read all project markdown documents and examine the codebase to ground in the project's actual state.

## Scope Analysis

For the proposed work:

$ARGUMENTS

Map the full scope:

1. **Surface area** — What files, modules, and systems does this touch? List them explicitly.
2. **Dependency chain** — What does this change depend on? What depends on it? Draw the graph.
3. **Interface changes** — Do any APIs, data models, contracts, or public interfaces change? These are the expensive parts.
4. **New capabilities needed** — Does this require new libraries, services, infrastructure, or permissions?
5. **Test impact** — What existing tests break? What new tests are needed?
6. **Documentation impact** — What docs need updating?
7. **Minimum viable version** — What's the smallest useful slice? What can be deferred to a follow-up?
8. **Full version** — What does the complete implementation look like?
9. **Risk zones** — Which parts are well-understood vs. uncertain? Where might scope expand during implementation?

Present as:
- **Impact summary**: 1-3 sentences on overall scope
- **File/module list**: Specific locations that change
- **Minimum viable version**: Concrete description of the smallest useful deliverable
- **Risk flags**: Areas of uncertainty or potential scope expansion

No changes to files — document only.

## Output Management

If the analysis is extensive, deliver the highest-priority findings first. Keep output concise — dense observations, not expansive prose. Note remaining sections available on request.
