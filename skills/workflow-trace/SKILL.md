## Workflow Trace

Trace the specified workflow end-to-end:

$ARGUMENTS

For the given persona or workflow:

1. **Map every step** — From trigger to completion, what happens at each stage?
2. **Identify friction** — Where does the flow break, slow down, or require unnecessary effort?
3. **Find missing steps** — What's assumed but not specified? What's implicit that should be explicit?
4. **Check handoffs** — Where does responsibility transfer between systems, roles, or states? Are handoffs clean?
5. **Evaluate error paths** — What happens when things go wrong at each step? Is recovery possible?
6. **Assess completeness** — Does the workflow achieve its stated goal? Are there paths that lead nowhere?

For every friction point or gap:
1. Where in the workflow it occurs
2. What the impact is (blocks progress, degrades experience, causes confusion)
3. The proposed resolution
4. Where it should be documented

Present as an ordered action list following the workflow sequence. No changes to files — document only.
