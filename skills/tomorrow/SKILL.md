description: Future-self documentation. While context is fresh, capture what will confuse you in 6 months — workarounds, magic numbers, implicit assumptions, dragons. Not reference docs — survival notes.

Examine the codebase, recent changes, and project documents.

## Tomorrow Notes

Capture what future-you needs to know:

1. **The non-obvious** — What code looks wrong but is actually correct? What workarounds exist and why? What would you "fix" if you didn't know the context?
2. **Magic values** — Numbers, strings, thresholds, or timeouts that look arbitrary but have specific reasons. Document the reason, not just the value.
3. **Implicit ordering** — Things that must happen in a specific order but nothing enforces it. Initialization sequences, migration steps, deployment procedures.
4. **Fragile spots** — Code that works but will break if touched the wrong way. Areas where a reasonable-looking change would cause subtle bugs.
5. **Context that will evaporate** — Why was this approach chosen over the obvious alternative? What did you try that didn't work? What constraints existed that might not be apparent?
6. **Dependency knowledge** — Library quirks, API behaviors, platform-specific gotchas that you learned the hard way.
7. **The dragons** — Areas where "here be dragons" is the honest documentation. What should future-you approach with extreme caution?

Focus area: $ARGUMENTS

For every note:
1. What the thing is
2. Why it matters (what breaks or confuses without this knowledge)
3. Where to put the note (inline comment, CLAUDE.md, dedicated doc)

Present as an action list of notes to add. No changes to files — document only.

## Output Management

If the analysis is extensive, deliver the highest-priority findings first. Keep output concise — dense observations, not expansive prose. Note remaining sections available on request.
