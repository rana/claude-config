Deep multi-dimensional perspective — biased toward action.

Read CONTEXT.md, DESIGN.md, DECISIONS.md, and ROADMAP.md first to ground your exploration in the project's actual state.

$ARGUMENTS

Be proactive — propose concrete actions, not just observations. For every insight, answer:
1. What specific change would this imply? (code, design, decision, or document)
2. Where exactly does it belong? (file, section, Identifier number, ADR, etc)
3. What's the next step to act on it?

Present proposed changes as a clear action list the user can approve, reject, or refine. Do not modify any files — document only.

## Output Management

If the analysis produces extensive findings, segment output by section. Complete one section fully, then pause and confirm before continuing to the next. Do not attempt to deliver all findings in a single response.

What questions would I benefit from asking?

What am I not asking?

You have complete design autonomy.
